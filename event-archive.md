       <a href="https://twitter.com/feministPLT" target=
       "_self">Daira Hopwood</a> on designing new error handling
       features in programming languages.&nbsp;<br>

       <br>
       <b>Error handling</b> is one of the most difficult
       problems in computer science and in practical
       programming. Incorrect error handling often leads to
       security vulnerabilities (such as many of the recent
       spate of bugs found in TLS implementations), data loss,
       and user frustration.<br>
       <br>
       In this talk, we’ll first discuss why programs using
       existing error handling styles and mechanisms (return and
       status code checking, conditions and restarts, and
       exceptions) often fail to recover correctly from errors.
       We argue that this is due to a fundamental conflict
       between encapsulation and having enough information to
       recover a consistent state.<br>
       <br>
       Then we explain how this conflict can be solved by
       providing language support for automatically recovering
       the state before the call that failed, so that failures
       cannot cause inconsistency. We also describe how the
       <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/~tpkelly/Ken/" target=
       "_self">Ken protocol</a> complements this automatic
       recovery and extends it to asynchronous and distributed
       systems.<br>

       - Perhaps there are <b>better ways to design</b> software

       <p>This month, <a href="https://twitter.com/honzam399"
       target="_self">Jan Macháček</a> will explore how <a href=
       "http://www.reactive-streams.org/" target=
       "_self">Reactive Streams</a> address the challenges of
       systems that process flows of live data. Learn about the
       core principles (asynchrony & non-blocking, stream
       passing over asynchronous boundaries, back pressure)
       without worrying about any particular language or
       framework. For clarity & brevity, Jan will be using Akka
       Streams implementation of Reactive Streams in the code
       samples.</p>
       <p>You will not need any extensive <a href=
       "http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_self">Scala</a> or
       <a href="http://akka.io/" target="_self">Akka</a>
       experience to understand the core principles. Basic
       knowledge of Scala and Akka will help you understand the
       code portion of the talk, though the Akka Streams DSL is
       undestandable to even non-Scala folk.</p>

       getting a talk on a language we've been eager to hear
       about.&nbsp; <b>Erlang!</b><br>
       <br>
       This month Brett will be introducing us to <a href=
       "http://erlang.org/" target="_self">Erlang</a>, one of
       most commercially successful functional languages, which
       has found its home in robust systems such as <a href=
       "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrIjfIjssLE" target=
       "_self">telephony switches</a>, <a href=
       "http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_self">Couch DB</a>,
       <a href="http://basho.com/riak/" target="_self">Riak</a>
       and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target=
       "_self">Rabbit MQ</a>.<br>
       <br>
       Erlang was originally developed by <a href=
       "http://www.ericsson.com/uk" target="_self">Erricson</a>
       for programming highly fault tolerant systems which have
       attained an <a href=
       "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8426897/erlangs-99-9999999-nine-nines-reliability"
       target="_self">alleged 99.9999999% availability</a>.<br>
       <br>
       Erlang has lots of cool features which set it apart from
       many other languages including:<br>
       <br>
       - A crash first approach to error handling.<br>
       - A virtual machine that allows hot swapping code in
       production without service disruption.<br>
       - A highly concurrent Actor model, supporting millions of
       concurrent processes on a single machine.<br>
       - Pattern matching.<br>

       intersection between music and functional

       the usual <b>7pm</b> start time.<br>
       <br>
       Alex is a laptop musician and researcher based in
       Sheffield, performing as part of <a href=
       "http://slub.org/" target="_self">Slub</a> and working at
       the <a href="http://icsrim.org.uk/" target=
       "_self">Interdisciplinary Centre for Scientific Research
       in</a> <a href="http://icsrim.org.uk/" target=
       "_self">Music</a>, University of Leeds. Alex is going to
       talk about his long term project of getting people to
       dance to code.<br>
       <br>
       <a href="http://toplap.org/" target="_self">Live
       coders</a> take advantage of dynamic interpreters to
       improvise live music (and/or video) with sourcecode,
       using a computer language as a musical environment. A
       live code edit<br>
       is something like changing the design of a machine while
       it runs, moving cogs and pistons around and adding new
       ones. Here though the machine is composed of text,
       describing the functions which the music flows out of.
       Music is not made by the machine, but by changes to the
       machine. The musicians editor is projected for the
       audience so that they see the live coders gestures within
       their text editor, and if they like, read the code as it
       is written.<br>
       <br>
       In this talk Alex will show how he live codes in
       <b>haskell</b> to make music, including how he represents
       musical patterns as functions of time, interfaces with
       synthesis software over the OSC protocol, and uses
       <b>emacs</b> as an interface in musical improvisation.
       He'll also introduce his new visual editor for <a href=

       <br>
       We will be meeting at the normal time of 7pm.<br>
       <br>
       <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target=
       "_self">Scala</a> is a multi-paradigm programming
       language targeting the JVM, CLR and Javascript. As well
       as a powerful object system, it has extensive support for
       functional programming including first-class functions,
       algebraic data types, pattern matching and immutable data
       structures. The goal of this talk is to give an
       introduction to the language, highlight interesting
       features of its type system and provide a comparison to
       functional langauges like Haskell and F#.<br>
       <br>
       Lee's talk will be followed by a deeper dive into Scala
       by Ian Murray on <b>Monday 21st October</b> where we will
       have a follow on presentation on Scala which will cover
       some more advanced areas of the language and its API's

       </div>This monday, we'll be meeting at @madlabuk at
       <b>7pm</b> and listening to <b>Chris Warburton</b> tell
       us about an advanced branch of type systems known
       as&nbsp;<a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type" target=
       "_self">dependent types</a>.<br>
       <br>
       Functional programming languages such as <b>Haskell</b>
       and <b>ML</b> are known for<br>
       their powerful type systems which can prevent many common
       programming<br>
       errors. Recently, these type systems have been growing
       more complex and confusing in order to capture more
       program properties.<br>
       <br>
       At the same time, a number of languages have emerged
       which use <b>Dependent</b> <b>Types</b> instead, such as
       <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/" target="_self">Coq</a>,
       <a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php"
       target="_self">Agda</a> and <a href=
       "http://www.idris-lang.org/" target="_self">Idris</a>.
       Dependent Types are <b>more powerful</b> than those of
       <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29"
       target="_self">ML</a> or <b>Haskell</b>, but are
       conceptually simpler. Their flexibility captures
       everything from dynamically-typed scripts up to <b>fully
       verified systems</b>.<br>
       <br>
       This <b>introductory talk</b> will describe the basics of
       <b>Dependent Types</b>, work through some examples in the
       <b>Idris language</b> to incrementally verify more and
       more properties of a simple algorithm, then discuss the
       consequences and drawbacks of using dependently typed
       languages.<br>

       <br>
       Having been inspired by Ian Johnson's talk on Arrows,
       Lambda Lounger, James Richardson went and implemented
       something in Scala to help understand the core concepts
       of arrows.&nbsp;<br>
       <br>
       The process of implementing Monads and Arrows gave an
       interesting insight into their usage which he'll be
       sharing at this months Lambda Lounge.&nbsp;<br>
       <br>
       This talk will work from the ground up, starting with
       some common (but simplified) programming problems we'll
       try to pull out some monad implementations.&nbsp; This
       will lead us to implement the maybe monad and the state
       monad.&nbsp; Next we'll try and generalise monad's into
       an arrow form before finally getting stuck with
       implementing monads as arrows in the Kleisli Arrow.<br>
       <br>
       From this talk you'll hopefully get an understanding of
       the why/what/how of monads as well as a peek into what
       Scala has to offer the functional programmer.<br>

       </div>This monday we'll be meeting at the usual place
       (<a href="http://madlab.org.uk/" target=
       "_self">Madlab</a>) and time <b>(7pm</b>) to hear Ian
       Johnson talk about his implementation of a Python DSL
       using Arrows.<br>
       <br>
       Arrows allow the programmer to abstract and combine
       computation. Arrows present operators with which
       pipelines of computation can be constructed. Arrows are
       related to Monads but allow for more interesting
       pipelines to be constructed, allow computations with more
       than one input, and allow, possibly partially, static
       computation. It has been said that, "If your application
       works fine with monads, you might as well stick with
       them. But if you're using a structure that's very like a
       monad, but isn't one, maybe it's an arrow."<br>
       <br>
       Ian has been working on the <a href=
       "http://www.statmt.org/mosescore/" target=
       "_self">MosesCore project</a>, funded by the European
       Commission 7th Framework Programme. "MosesCore aims to
       encourage the development and usage of open source
       machine translation tools. Computational pipelines occur
       often in machine translation systems and it was deemed
       necessary to design an easy method to compose and share
       pipelines and pipeline components. During this work a
       Python library called <a href=
       "https://github.com/ianj-als/pypeline" target=
       "_self">Pypeline</a>. was written to support arrows. It
       defines monadic and arrow types and allows programmer to
       compose pipelines using helper functions. <a href=
       "https://github.com/ianj-als/pcl" target="_self">PCL</a>,
       on the other hand, is a DSL that supports arrow operators
       so that programmers may easily construct and share
       pipelines, or bits of pipelines.<br>
       <br>
       Ian will be taking you through the Pypeline library and,
       hopefully, you'll pick up what arrows are all about. Then
       we'll dive into PCL by looking at the packaged
       examples.<br>

       <h3>Software Transactional Memory</h3>This month's
       <b>lambda lounge</b> sees Haskell enthusiast and
       developer <b>Lee Kitching,</b> talking about Haskell's
       <b>Software Transactional Memory</b>.&nbsp; We will be
       meeting at the usual time of <b>7pm</b>.<br>
       <br>
       The traditional approach to <b>concurrency</b> uses locks
       to co-ordinate access to shared state. This approach is
       <i>flawed</i> in a number of ways:
       <div>
         <br>
         1: It requires a global ordering on lock acquisition to
         prevent deadlock
       </div>
       <div>
         <br>
         2: It is difficult to maintain consistency in the face
         of errors
       </div>
       <div>
         <br>
         3: Lock granularity has a significant impact on
         scalability.
       </div>
       <div>
         <br>
       </div>
       <div>
         <b>Transactional memory systems</b> allow accesses to
         shared memory to be defined within <b>atomic
         transactions</b> whose effects are <b>isolated</b> from
         any concurrently executing transactions.
       </div>
       <div>
         Haskell's STM system leverages the Haskell <b>type
         system</b> to permit access to shared state only within
         transactions. It allows transactions to be
         <b>composed</b> by automatically handling transaction
         <b>scheduling</b>, <b>isolation</b>, <b>execution</b>
         and <b>rollback</b> in the event of errors.
       </div>
       <div>
         <br>
       </div>
       <div>
         The talk will introduce <b>Haskell's STM system</b>,

         <b>functional&nbsp;language</b>&nbsp;that runs on the
         <b>.NET runtime</b>. Unlike other languages such as
         Haskell it is not purely functional and also has
         support for <b>imperative</b> and <b>object oriented
         programming</b>.&nbsp;F# is open source and has been
         officially supported in <b>Visual Studio</b> since
         2010, but it can also run on the <b>Mono runtime</b>.

       Haskell is a purely functional programming language,
       where side-effects are forbidden by the type-system; and
       all functions must be pure.&nbsp;<br>
       <br>
       Haskell's widely regarded as being on the cutting edge of
       programming language design, with its rigorous <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner">Hindley-Milner</a>
       inferencing type system, <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy
       evaluation</a> and infamous use of&nbsp; an obscure
       branch of <a href=

       nonsense</a> (category theory).<br>
       <br>
       <br>
       Haskell is best known for it's ability to lock up side
       effects where they belong, in an IO::Monad; preventing
       them from polluting your program with pain and
       non-determinism.<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Haskell.pdf">The

       <br>
       After learning its syntax, semantics and special forms in
       Clojure's interactive development environment you'll free
       your mind of mutable thoughts and <span class="c4">seek
       enlightenment</span> with <span class="c4">Value Oriented
       Programming</span>; the secret behind <span class=
       "c4">safe</span> and <span class="c4">efficient</span>
       <span class="c4">concurrent</span> <span class=
       "c4">programming</span> with Clojure.<br>
       <br>
       You'll discover how <a href=
       "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">laziness
       is a virtue</a> with Clojure's powerful sequence API,
       learn how to embrace the worlds largest set of
       <span class="c4">open source</span> class libraries with
       the most native foreign function interface ever defined,
       and take a look at how in Clojure <span class="c6">code
       is data</span>; allowing you to <span class="c7">extend
       the Compiler</span> and the language to <span class=
       "c7">better solve problems</span> in your domain.<br>
       <br>
       By the end of this session, you'll begin to appreciate
       how you might use Clojure to tackle programming problems
       with <span class="c4">less ceremony</span>, incidental
       complexity and a <span class="c6">greater degree of
       expressiveness</span>.
