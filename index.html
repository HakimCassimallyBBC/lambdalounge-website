                <div>This month <span><a href="https://twitter.com/osfameron">Hakim Cassimally</a> is presenting on <b>Data Structures for Text Editors</b>.
                    &nbsp; We're meeting on Monday 16th Jan in <b>madlab</b> at the
                    normal time of <b>7pm</b>.
                    <div>
                    To support the features that we need as programmers, <b>text
                    editors</b> arrange textual data in rather different ways than
                    we might expect from other text-processing tasks, where we
                    commonly use strings and streams of characters.
                    <br>
                    We'll first look at some classic text editor
                    data-structures like <b>Lists of lines</b> (vi, Atom), the
                    <b>Gap Buffer</b> (Emacs), and then at purely functional
                    data structures that fit better with functional languages -
                    structures like <b>Piece Tables</b> (Abiword, Bravo), various
                    sorts of tree (the infamous Xanadu, GtkTextBuffer) and
                    <b>Zippers</b> (yi).
                    <br>
                    I'll be showing a few examples in <b>Clojure</b>, but the
                    approaches are valuable in any language (I've done previous
                    prototypes in <b>Perl</b>, <b>Java</b>, and
                    <b>Haskell</b>!) </div>

 port of Quickcheck. The API will be introduced before being
demonstrated in development of a simple regular expression engine, and
used to check invariants for data structures.<br>

However laziness is problematic when streams are derived from resources such as file handles which are consumed incrementally and require prompt cleanup since streams hide the nature of the source from the consumer. This presents a risk of resource leaks if clients fail to consume the entire stream, or inefficient use of resources if the problem is avoided by consuming the entire stream eagerly.<br><br>This talk describes the abstraction defined by the Pipes library and demonstrates how it can be used to define reusable streaming components.<br>

 pattern will free you to focus on the unique aspects of your problem.
<p>The strategy was first described by Hadley Wickham with a
implementation he wrote in <a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_self">GNU-R</a>. With roots in Scheme and S, R is a
statistical language and computing environment offering both functional
programming features (first class functions, higher-order functions, and

Incorrect error handling often leads to security vulnerabilities (such as many of the recent spate of bugs found in TLS implementations), data loss, and user frustration.<br><br>In this talk, we’ll first discuss why programs using existing error handling styles and mechanisms (return and status code checking, conditions and restarts, and exceptions) often fail to recover correctly from errors. We argue that this is due to a fundamental conflict between encapsulation and having enough information to recover a consistent state.<br><br>Then we explain how this conflict can be solved by providing language support for automatically recovering the state before the call that failed, so that failures cannot cause inconsistency. We also describe how the <a href="http://ai.eecs.umich.edu/~tpkelly/Ken/" target="_self">Ken protocol</a> complements this automatic recovery and extends it to asynchronous and distributed systems.<br>

 address the challenges of systems that process flows of live data.
Learn about the core principles (asynchrony &amp; non-blocking, stream
passing over asynchronous boundaries, back pressure) without worrying
about any particular language or framework. For clarity &amp; brevity,
Jan will be using Akka Streams implementation of Reactive Streams in the
 code samples.</p>

<p>You will not need any extensive <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/" target="_self">Scala</a> or <a href="http://akka.io/" target="_self">Akka</a> experience to
understand the core principles. Basic knowledge of Scala and Akka will

Alex is going to talk about his long term project of getting people to dance to code.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://toplap.org/" target="_self">Live coders</a> take advantage of dynamic interpreters to improvise live music (and/or video) with sourcecode, using a computer language as a musical environment. A live code edit<br>
is something like changing the design of a machine while it runs, moving cogs and pistons around and adding new ones. Here though the machine is composed of text, describing the functions which the music flows out of. Music is not made by the machine, but by changes to the machine. The musicians editor is projected for the audience so that they see the live coders gestures within their text editor, and if they like, read the code as it is written.<br>
<br>
In this talk Alex will show how he live codes in <b>haskell</b> to make music, including how he represents musical patterns as functions of time, interfaces with synthesis software over the OSC protocol, and uses <b>emacs</b> as an interface in musical improvisation. He'll also introduce his new visual editor for <a href="http://yaxu.org/demonstrating-tidal/" target="_self">Tidal</a>, called Texture.<br>

Javascript. As well as a powerful object system, it has extensive
support for functional programming including first-class functions,
algebraic data types, pattern matching and immutable data structures.
The goal of this talk is to give an introduction to the language,
highlight interesting features of its type system and provide a
comparison to functional langauges like Haskell and F#.<br><br>Lee's talk will be followed by a deeper dive into Scala by Ian Murray on <b>Monday 21st October</b>
 where we will have a follow on presentation on Scala which will cover some
more advanced areas of the language and its API's and tools.<br>

							This monday, we'll be meeting at @madlabuk at <b>7pm</b> and listening to <b>Chris Warburton </b>tell us about an advanced branch of type systems known as&nbsp;<b></b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_type" target="_self">dependent types</a>.<br><br>
Functional programming languages such as <b>Haskell</b> and <b>ML</b> are known for<br>
their powerful type systems which can prevent many common programming<br>
errors. Recently, these type systems have been growing more complex and confusing in order to capture more program properties.<br>
<br>
At the same time, a number of languages have emerged which use <b>Dependent</b> <b>Types</b> instead, such as <a href="http://coq.inria.fr/" target="_self">Coq</a>, <a href="http://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php" target="_self">Agda</a> and <a href="http://www.idris-lang.org/" target="_self">Idris</a>. Dependent Types are <b>more powerful</b> than those of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29" target="_self">ML</a> or <b>Haskell</b>, but are conceptually simpler. Their flexibility captures everything from dynamically-typed scripts up to <b>fully verified systems</b>.<br>
<br>
This <b>introductory talk</b> will describe the basics of <b>Dependent Types</b>, work through some examples in the <b>Idris language</b> to incrementally verify more and more properties of a simple algorithm, then discuss the consequences and drawbacks of using dependently typed languages.<br>

							This month we'll be meeting at the madlab at the usual time of <b>7pm</b>.<br><br>Having been inspired by Ian Johnson's talk on
Arrows, Lambda Lounger, James Richardson went and implemented something in Scala to
help understand the core concepts of arrows.&nbsp; <br>
<br>The process of implementing Monads and Arrows gave an interesting insight into their usage which he'll be sharing at this months Lambda Lounge.&nbsp; <br><br>This
 talk will work from the ground up, starting with some common (but
simplified) programming problems we'll try to pull out some monad
implementations.&nbsp; This will lead us to implement the maybe monad and the
 state monad.&nbsp; Next we'll try and generalise monad's into an arrow form
before finally getting stuck with implementing monads as arrows in the
Kleisli Arrow.<br>
<br>From this talk you'll hopefully get an understanding of the
why/what/how of monads as well as a peek into what Scala has to offer
the functional programmer.<br>

present operators with which pipelines of computation can be
constructed. Arrows are related to Monads but allow for more interesting
 pipelines to be constructed, allow computations with more than one
input, and allow, possibly partially, static computation. It has been
said that, "If your application works fine with monads, you might as
well stick with them. But if you're using a structure that's very like a
 monad, but isn't one, maybe it's an arrow."<br>
<br>
Ian has been working on the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/mosescore/" target="_self">MosesCore project</a>,
 funded by the European Commission 7th Framework Programme. "MosesCore
aims to encourage the development and usage of open source machine
translation tools. Computational pipelines occur often in machine
translation systems and it was deemed necessary to design an easy method
 to compose and share pipelines and pipeline components. During this
work a Python library called <a href="https://github.com/ianj-als/pypeline" target="_self">Pypeline</a>.
 was written to support arrows. It defines monadic and arrow types and
allows programmer to compose pipelines using helper functions. <a href="https://github.com/ianj-als/pcl" target="_self">PCL</a>,
 on the other hand, is a DSL that supports arrow operators so that
programmers may easily construct and share pipelines, or bits of
pipelines.<br>
<br>
Ian will be taking you through the Pypeline library and, hopefully,
you'll pick up what arrows are all about. Then we'll dive into PCL by
looking at the packaged examples.<br>

							<h3>Software Transactional Memory</h3>This month's <b>lambda lounge</b> sees Haskell enthusiast and developer <b>Lee Kitching,</b> talking about Haskell's <b>Software Transactional Memory</b>.&nbsp; We will be meeting at the usual time of <b>7pm</b>.<br><br>The traditional approach to <b>concurrency</b> uses
locks to co-ordinate access to shared state. This approach is <i>flawed</i> in a
 number of ways:
<div><br>1: It requires a global ordering on lock acquisition to prevent deadlock</div><div><br>2: It is difficult to maintain consistency in the face of errors</div><div><br>3: Lock granularity has a significant impact on scalability.</div>
<div><br></div><div><b>Transactional memory systems</b> allow accesses to
shared memory to be defined within <b>atomic transactions </b>whose effects are
<b> isolated</b> from any concurrently executing transactions.</div><div>Haskell's
 STM system leverages the Haskell <b>type system</b> to permit access to shared
 state only within transactions. It allows transactions to be <b>composed</b>
by automatically handling transaction <b>scheduling</b>, <b>isolation</b>, <b>execution</b>
and <b>rollback</b> in the event of errors.</div>
<div><br></div><div>The talk will introduce <b>Haskell's STM system</b>, and show how it can be used to greatly <b>simplify</b> some concurrent programming tasks.</div>

							<h3> An Introduction to applicative functors in Haskell</h3><div>This months talk, graciously hosted by <a rel="nofollow" target="_self" href="http://madlab.org.uk/">Madab</a> <b>@7pm</b> will be given by <b>Ian Murray</b>, and should be a real hit as he hopes to cover some of the core theoretical concepts found in Haskell.<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_self" href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell/Applicative_Functors">Applicative
 functors</a> are an abstraction that sit between functors and monads:
weaker (hence more widely occurring) than monads, and stronger than
functors.</div><br>This practical talk will be split into two parts:<br><br><b>1.</b>&nbsp;An introduction to
the definition of the Applicative type class.&nbsp; Will show some examples
of Applicative instances to get a feel for it. &nbsp;And then discuss how it's used; and how it achieves what a Functor can't.<br><br>

<div><b>2.</b> Will look at the
applicative-style of programming in Haskell, using user input validation
 as an example of this (including a
brief detour to introduce the Monoid type class).</div><div><br></div><div>The slides for this talk are <a rel="nofollow" target="_self" href="https://github.com/icmurray/presentations/blob/master/applicative_functors/slides/slides.markdown">available here</a>.</div>

							This meeting was on the 28th May featured an introductory talk on <a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell">Haskell</a>, by <a href="http://twitter.com/#%21/__ian_johnson">Ian Johnson</a>.<br><br><a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell"><img alt="" src="./assets/haskellwiki_logo.png"></a><br><br>Haskell is a purely functional programming language, where
side-effects are forbidden by the type-system; and all functions must be
 pure.&nbsp; <br><br>Haskell's widely regarded as being on the cutting edge
of programming language design, with its rigorous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner">Hindley-Milner</a>
inferencing type system, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation">lazy evaluation</a> and infamous use of&nbsp; an obscure branch of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_nonsense.">abstract nonsense</a> (category theory).<br><br><br>Haskell is best known for it's ability to lock up side
effects where they belong, in an IO::Monad; preventing them from
polluting your program with pain and non-determinism.<a href="/downloads/Haskell.pdf">The slide</a><a href="downloads//Haskell.pdf">s</a> for this talk can be downloaded below.<br><br>
