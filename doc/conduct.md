# Code of Conduct

As a group the
[Manchester Lambda Lounge](http://www.lambdalounge.org.uk/) not only
has a diversity of interests but also a diverse membership which at
times consists of people of different genders, gender identities,
races, sexualities, religions, abilities and opinions.  So regardless
of whether you're
[Ada Lovelace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace),
[Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing),
[Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), or
[Muhammad al-Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_Musa_al-Khwarizmi),
we're all just people struggling to understand and share profound
ideas.

However, Lambda Lounge is not about harrasment, bullying, or
spreading misogynistic, sexist or hateful views & rhetoric.
Behaviours such as these are beyond the limits of our tolerance.

We hope for everyone to always meet in a spirit of friendship,
conducive to sharing knowledge and experience.  Tolerance of others
who may be different to yourself is a very low bar, and is the minimum
we should expect of ourselves, but we should always aspire for more.

We believe Lambda Lounge has been respectful and inclusive of all
attendees since we began in 2010, and have formalised this document as
both an ongoing commitment to our members and as a means to promote
equality and diversity in the technology industry.

The [GeekFeminism Wiki](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki)
is an excellent resource to learn about implicit and explicit forms of
discrimination you might not even be aware of.

If you consider anyone in attendance at a Lambda Lounge meeting to be
in violation of the spirit of this document then do not hesitate to
contact either [myself](http://twitter.com/RickMoynihan) or one of the
organisers.

If you feel we are not adequately addressing your concern you can as a
last resort contact MadLab.  Madlab have an
[Equal Opportunities Policy](https://madlab.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/EqualOpportunitiesPolicy.pdf),
and like us, follow madlab director, Rachael Turner's universal
principle of:

In addition participants should remember that speakers at Lambda
Lounge are not always experts on their subject matter.  Often speakers
are talking about a topic they have only just started learning, so be
mindful when correcting them on technical matters of the effort they
have put in to try and help educate others.  Feel free to politely
correct them, but please respect their commitment over their accuracy.
