<div>This monday at 7pm we have PLT guru Lee Kitching
talking about Pipes.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes"
target="_self">Pipes</a> is a Haskell library based on a
composable push/pull streaming abstraction.<br>
<br>
Laziness is crucial for defining reusable algorithms
which can be freely composed together, and most modern
languages define an abstractions for lazy sequences such
as Java 8 Streams and IEnumerable in C#. However laziness
is problematic when streams are derived from resources
such as file handles which are consumed incrementally and
require prompt cleanup since streams hide the nature of
the source from the consumer. This presents a risk of
resource leaks if clients fail to consume the entire
stream, or inefficient use of resources if the problem is
avoided by consuming the entire stream eagerly.<br>
<br>
This talk describes the abstraction defined by the Pipes
library and demonstrates how it can be used to define
reusable streaming components.<br>
