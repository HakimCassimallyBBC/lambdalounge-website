<div>This month saw Scala developer, Jaakko Pallari,
talk about how Free monads are a general way of deriving
monads for functor data types.<br>
<br>
Besides reducing the boilerplate for creating new monads,
they allow customising how the monads are
interpreted.<br>
<br>
Jakko demonstrated what free monads can be used for in
practice, as well as how the free monad itself is
structured.<br>
<br>
The code examples in Haskell can be applied to other
functional programming languages as well.<br>
