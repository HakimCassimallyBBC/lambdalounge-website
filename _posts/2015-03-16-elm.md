<div>This month on <b>Monday 16th</b> <b>@7pm</b> we
have <a href="http://blog.doppioslash.com/" target=
"_self">Claudia Doppioslash</a> talking about the
adventures she's been having exploring the Elm
programming language.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://elm-lang.org/" target="_self">Elm</a> is
a <b>Functional Reactive Programming</b> language that
targets the web (Javascript, Html, CSS). Reactive
Programming, which has gotten in the mainstream with the
<b>Microsoft Rx extensions</b>, is basically a better
abstraction for anything that requires interactivity,
like GUIs and games.<br>
<br>
Some useful features of Elm are a <b>Time Travelling
debugger</b> (which is remarkably similar to <a href=
"https://vimeo.com/36579366" target="_self">Bret
Victors</a>'), <b>hot code swapping</b>, immutability,
<b>Union Types</b>, type inference and of course
<b>FRP</b>.<br>
<br>
We will be meeting at <a href="http://madlab.org.uk/"
target="_self">Madlab</a> as usual.<br>
