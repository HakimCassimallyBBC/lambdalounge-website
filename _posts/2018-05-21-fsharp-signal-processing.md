So this is very exciting for several reasons: our next meeting is on Monday 21st
May at MadLab's new venue at [PLANT NOMA][PlantNoma]
(Redfern, Dantzic Street, NOMA, M60 0AE).

(See MadLab's [announcement][PlantNomaAnnouncement] for more details.)

We'll be learning about Audio Synthesis in F# with [John Stovin][johnstovin].
This is a re-run of his very popular workshop at F# Exchange this year, and should be lots of fun!  This meeting is brought to you in collaboration with the
[Manchester F# User Group][fsharp].

Planning for the usual 7pm (doors open a little earlier, we aim to start by 7:05pm), but do keep an eye out
for any changes, as it's a slightly new setup.

Please [register][eventbrite] to let us know you'll be attending.

In this workshop, [John Stovin][johnstovin] will show how several features in F#
work together make it an ideal platform for creating high-performing real-time
applications for a wide variety of application areas. Specifically, John will
share with you how reactive event handling and lazy sequences can be used
together to create a simple software-based audio synthesizer.

No knowledge of signal processing theory is required. John will start with a
simple, non-technical and non-mathematical explanation of the basic concepts of
digital signal processing. John will then build on that explanation to show how
to design a basic signal flow and processing elements using pure functional
elements, and how to make this signal flow interact with external devices in
real time.

Functional topics covered will include: Seq & List; Event Handling; Sequence comprehension; Higher-order functions, particularly unfold.

Have you done audio or music work with a functional programming language.
Let us know on [twitter][lambdamcr] or at beginning of the session, and we should have time for some
show-and-tell at the end of the session!

(Please [register][eventbrite] to let us know you'll be coming!)

(And please get in touch if you'd like to talk at a future event: (contact the [mailing list][ML] or ping
[@lambdamcr][lambdamcr], or speak to us at the event!
We're a very supportive crowd, do let us know if you have any questions!)
