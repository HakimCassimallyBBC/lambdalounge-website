<div>This Monday at <b>7pm</b>, we'll be looking at
<a href="http://www.jstatsoft.org/v40/i01/paper" target=
"_self">Split-Apply-Combine</a> a strategy for analysing
data: split up the problem, apply a function, and combine
the pieces.<br>
<br>
Adopting this pattern will free you to focus on the
unique aspects of your problem.
<p>The strategy was first described by Hadley Wickham
with a implementation he wrote in <a href=
"https://www.r-project.org/" target="_self">GNU-R</a>.
With roots in Scheme and S, R is a statistical language
and computing environment offering both functional
programming features (first class functions, higher-order
functions, and closures) and support for
objects.</p>Robin Gower, of <a href=
"http://infonomics.ltd.uk/" target=
"_self">Infonomics</a>, is a data scientist with many
years experience using <a href=
"https://www.r-project.org/" target="_self">R</a> and he
will be providing us with an overview of the
split-apply-combine strategy and some live coded
examples.<br>
