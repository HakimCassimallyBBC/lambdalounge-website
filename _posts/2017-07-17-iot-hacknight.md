### Hacknight: The Functional Internet of Things

We're meeting on Monday **17**th July at 7pm at
<b>MadLab</b> to play with microcontrollers and
functional languages!  We will have some instructions
for very simple projects that you can extend.
Alternatively, you are welcome to work on a project
of your own, or join other attendees to help them.

After our [May talks on IoT][last-time] we'll meet to work together
on various Internet of Things projects.  This will be a **Hands On**
session, so please do bring:


```
 * laptop
 * any electronics kit you have that you'd like to play with
```

But don't worry: we will bring various microcontrollers: ESP8266, Arduino, some
BBC micro:bits etc.

We'll start by getting software installed and things setup, so do feel
free to arrive early if you can.  Then we'll do a brief brainstorming
exercise, and form into small teams (or work alone if you prepare)
on our projects!
