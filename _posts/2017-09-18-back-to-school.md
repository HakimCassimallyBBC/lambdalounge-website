### Back to School evening

As we reach the end of the Glorious British Summer, it's time to
pick up our new exercise books and pencil cases and learn some
new techniques on Javascript (and a bit of Clojure) in the field!

LambdaLounge is pleased to present an evening suitable for
all, and especially newcomers to Functional Programming
on Monday **18**th September at 7pm at <b>[MadLab][MadLab]</b>.

### A Functional JS Field Guide

<i>
[Katie Fenn][katie] ([@katie_fenn][katie_fenn]) is a software engineer at
[npm][npm]. She works with all aspects of the web, particularly JavaScript, CSS,
Node.JS and ops. When not at her desk, she is usually in the pool or on her bike
in the Peak District.

JavaScript is a language of two flavours: object-oriented and functional. Some
would say functional is JavaScript's dominant flavour, but only recently have we
started exploring its uses fully. I will show how lessons from functional
programming takes advantage of JavaScript's better features, and may even change
the future of computing.

In this talk I will introduce the basic ingredients of functional programming
and explain why embracing them makes JavaScript easier to work with. It will be
aimed at JavaScript developers of all experience levels and backgrounds.

### Writing a tile-matching game in Clojure (first steps)

Ever wondered how to write a tile-matching game (like Candy Crush and the
earlier Bejeweled)?  And how do you even write a *game* (with graphics, and
state, and user interaction!) *functionally*?  Regular speaker and co-organizer
Hakim is just starting to explore this process, and will present some of the
basics of modelling the game grid, and playing a basic event loop, introducing
some important concepts in functional programming.
