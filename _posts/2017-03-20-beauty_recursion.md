### Discovering the beauty of recursion and pattern matching

We're meeting on Monday **20**th Mar at 7pm at
<b>MadLab</b> where [DJ Adams](https://twitter.com/qmacro)
will speak about one of the essential features of functional
programming: <b>recursion.</b>

Moving from an imperative mindset across to a more
functional one requires some rewiring of your brain.
One of the areas where this is particularly noticeable
is understanding how iteration is achieved in languages
without explicit loop constructs. In this talk, we'll
look at recursion as a fundamental building block, and
discover how pattern matching in Haskell, Clojure, Elm,
Elixir and even JavaScript is a beautiful thing.
