<h3>Calling all Javascripters!</h3><br>
This Monday we have two talks talking about how to write
<b>better Javascript</b> by using functional programming
techniques.<br>
<br>
Firstly <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_p_cannon"
target="_self">Matthew Cannon</a> will tell us about how
the functional features of Javascript and the lodash
framework helped deoderise his nodejs code.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This will be followed by <a href=
"http://twitter.com/RickMoynihan" target="_self">Rick
Moynihan</a> giving a brief talk and discussion on why
Javascripters might want to learn other functional
languages.<br>
<br>
We're meeting at the usual time of <b>7pm</b>
<b>@madlabuk</b>, so we'll see you there!<br>
