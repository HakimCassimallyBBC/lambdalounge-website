### Calling all Javascripters!

This Monday we have two talks talking about how to write
<b>better Javascript</b> by using functional programming
techniques.

Firstly <a href="https://twitter.com/matt_p_cannon"
target="_self">Matthew Cannon</a> will tell us about how
the functional features of Javascript and the lodash
framework helped deoderise his nodejs code.

This will be followed by <a href=
"http://twitter.com/RickMoynihan" target="_self">Rick
Moynihan</a> giving a brief talk and discussion on why
Javascripters might want to learn other functional
languages.

We're meeting at the usual time of <b>7pm</b>
<b>@madlabuk</b>, so we'll see you there!
