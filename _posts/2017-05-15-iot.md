### The Functional Internet of Things

We're meeting on Monday **15**th May at 7pm at
<b>MadLab</b> to talk about how Functional Programming
can be used to interact with the Internet of Things.

Firstly, Qambar Raza ([@QambarRaza](http://twitter.com/QambarRaza)) (BBC), who
is starting an
exciting project using the ESP8266 IC, Clojure, and Firmata and is
[blogging][qr-blog] all the way up to his talk and demo at LambdaLounge.

Our second confirmed speaker, Spencer Marsden ([@spencermarsden](https://twitter.com/spencermarsden)) (a creative technologist at the BBC's consumer technology showcase, the Blue Room) will give an overview of some of the exciting 
[projects](http://wimmera.co.uk/) and technology he's worked on.

**We can still make time for one or two more speakers! could <b>you</b> get involved?**

Perhaps you've written some dataflow based code on the Raspberry PI with NodeRED?
Or you've been experimenting with Haskell and hArduino?
Or have you been sneaking Functional concepts into C++ code on a PIC?

Whether you are enthusiastically tinkering on a hobby project, or have used
these technologies in a successful enterprise, we'd love to hear from you!

We're really keen to get a diverse range of speakers, from a wide range of
backgrounds and experience, whether you're a relative newcomer to functional
programming, a veteran developer, or an academic, we always provide a warm
welcome! See our [call for speakers](/cfs) for more details or ping us at
[@lambdamcr](https://twitter.com/lambdamcr)!
