<h3>Introducing Rust</h3>
<div>
This Monday at the usual time of <b>7pm</b>, <a href=
"https://twitter.com/michaelpjones" target=
"_self">Michael Jones</a> will introduce the <a href=
"http://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_self">Rust
programming language</a> from Mozilla with an overview
of the goals of the project, what has been achieved so
far and a focus on some of the functional influences in
the language.

Rust is a systems programming language, that is gaining
traction.&nbsp; Its features include an innovative borrow
checker, and many zero-cost abstractions to ensure type
and memory safety.<br>
