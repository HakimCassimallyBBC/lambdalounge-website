<h3>Show and Tell<br></h3>
<p>The lambda lounge this Monday are doing a show and
tell.&nbsp; We'll meet at <b>@madlabuk</b> at <b>7pm</b>
as usual.<br></p>
<p>It's going to be a pretty informal round table
discussion, so bring something along to chat about that
you think will be interesting to the Lambda
Lounge!<br></p>
<p>Things you could bring...</p>
<p>- <b>A cool book</b> you've read on Functional
Programming or Computer Science</p>
<p>- An <b>interesting paper</b>, you've read on Computer
Science, Types, Functional Programming etc...</p>
<p>- A <b>neat algorithm</b><br></p>
<p>- An <b>awesome API</b> you've found</p>
<p>- A <b>blog article</b> you've found interesting.</p>
<p>Ideally you should be able to talk about what you've
brought for a <b>minute or two</b>.&nbsp; Feel free to
<b>bring as many things</b> as you want to chat about -
just try and keep them relevant to <b>computer
science</b> and/or <b>PLT</b>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don't worry if you don't have anything to bring</b>
- just come and join the conversations.<br></p>
