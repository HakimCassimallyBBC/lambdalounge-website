We'll meet on Monday 16th October, 7pm at [MadLab][MadLab] to learn about
**macros** in **Clojure**.

(We don't know yet if we'll be in the main section or the next door FabLab -
will be clearly signed and we'll try to [tweet][lambdamcr] details beforehand!)

### Clojure Macros - with great power comes much confusion

**Dan Meyers** (BBC Programme Metadata, [@Carr0t][Carr0t]) will go through the
basic building blocks of macros and how they differ from functions. He writes:

> "Anyone who's written any Clojure has probably *used* macros that are in the
> language core, even if they didn't realise it, but a lot of people might not
> have *written* their own macros.
>
> We'll go through two examples covering what I see as the major use-cases of
> macros -- logging and code readability.  We'll do this bit by bit to see how
> they do what they do, and then look at the results of that."

The talk starts from fairly basic principles and building on that so you don't
need to know Clojure or anything to understand it. A few brief slides at the
beginning give you all the info you need to understand what's going on even if
you've not really looked at a Lisp-like language before.
