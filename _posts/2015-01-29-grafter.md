<div>This Monday <a href=
"http://twitter.com/RickMoynihan" target=
"_self">@RickMoynihan</a> will be introducing <a href=
"http://grafter.org/" target="_self">Grafter</a>, an
opensource <a href="http://clojure.org/" target=
"_self">Clojure</a> DSL developed by <a href=
"http://swirrl.com/" target="_self">Swirrl</a> to solve
the <a href=
"http://blog.swirrl.com/articles/linked-data-etl/"
target="_self">hard graft of linked data
ETL</a>.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
We'll look at how Clojure's <i>affordances</i> make it a
natural language for simplifying the process of cleaning
<b>tabular data</b> and converting it into <b>linked
graph data</b> and how we're&nbsp; building an
<b>interactive environment</b> for lay users to write
<b>purely functional programs.</b><br>
<br>
As usual we'll be meeting at <b>7pm</b> at
<b>Madlab</b>.<br>
