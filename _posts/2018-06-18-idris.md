This month Conor Farrell ([@SectoidCmdr][SectoidCmdr]) will give us an
Introduction to [Idris][idris].

> Idris is a purely functional language that has a number of interesting features like dependent types and totality checking. It can also be used as a proof assistant, similar to Coq and Agda.

> In this talk I'll cover development using Idris and how you can use types to help you write your code - rather than thinking of types just as things that need to be checked, we can instead see them as a plan for producing a robust program by following the three steps of type, define and refine.

> You don't need any experience with Idris or functional programming as I'll be starting from the basics, but if you do happen to know Haskell you'll probably see some similarities!
