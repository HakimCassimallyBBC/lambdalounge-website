   This month <span><a href=
   "https://twitter.com/osfameron">Hakim Cassimally</a> is
   presenting on <b>Data Structures for Text Editors</b>.
   &nbsp; We're meeting on Monday 16th Jan in
   <b>madlab</b> at the normal time of <b>7pm</b>.<br>
   To support the features that we need as programmers,
   <b>text editors</b> arrange textual data in rather
   different ways than we might expect from other
   text-processing tasks, where we commonly use strings
   and streams of characters.<br>
   We'll first look at some classic text editor
   data-structures like <b>Lists of lines</b> (vi, Atom),
   the <b>Gap Buffer</b> (Emacs), and then at purely
   functional data structures that fit better with
   functional languages - structures like <b>Piece
   Tables</b> (Abiword, Bravo), various sorts of tree (the
   infamous Xanadu, GtkTextBuffer) and <b>Zippers</b>
   (yi).<br>
   I'll be showing a few examples in <b>Clojure</b>, but
   the approaches are valuable in any language (I've done
   previous prototypes in <b>Perl</b>, <b>Java</b>, and
   <b>Haskell</b>!)<br></span>
