Come and learn some some Lisp with us! Clojure is a powerful dynamically typed language with a strong focus on immutability. It runs on the Java virtual machine, making interoperability with Java code easy. It's not just a back-end language, though - there's also a ClojureScript dialect which can be compiled to JavaScript, so you can use it for your full stack.

This month, we're running a workshop where we'll help you set up a Clojure development environment and run through some simple exercises to get you started. No experience required, but please bring your laptop!

If you're a more experienced Clojure developer, feel free to come and help out or work on your own project!
