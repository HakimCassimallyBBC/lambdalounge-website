</div><span>This Monday at 7pm Chi-chi Ekweozor is giving
a talk on <strong>the soft real-time</strong> aspects of
Elixir/Phoenix and its web sockets implementation (aka
Phoenix channels) - which was the main draw for building
a real-time Q&amp;A service with it over at <a href=
"http://assenty.com/" rel="nofollow">assenty.com</a>.
And, yes, there will be a live demo!</span>
