   This month after a brief hiatus we return at the usual
   time of <b>7pm</b> with a talk by DJ Adams
   entitled:<br>
   <br>
   <i>Learning by Doing: Beginning Clojure by Solving
   Puzzles</i>.
 </div>

   <br>
   DJ had this to say about his talk:<br>
   <br>
   "I'm teaching myself <a href="http://clojure.org/"
   target="_self">Clojure</a>, because awesome. In this
   talk, I'll relate some of my experiences in trying to
   discover how natives speak, by tackling puzzles in
   <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target=
   "_self">Project Euler</a> and <a href=
   "http://adventofcode.com/" target="_self">Advent of
   Code</a>.&nbsp; If you're a Clojure beginner too, or
   even if you're not, this might give you some confidence
   in taking a similar journey; if you're more
   experienced, it might be a comedy half hour. Either way
   it will be fun :-)"<br>
   <br>
   So come and join us for an interesting tour in applying
   a modern Lisp to classic computing and problems<br>
