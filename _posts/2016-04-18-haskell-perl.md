<div>
  This month <span><a href="https://twitter.com/osfameron">Hakim Cassimally</a>
  is presenting on why <b>"Haskell is an acceptable
  Perl"</b>.&nbsp; We're meeting on Monday in
  <b>madlab</b> at the normal time of
  <b>7pm</b>...&nbsp;<br>
  <br></span> So, Haskell is "an advanced
  <b>purely-functional</b> programming language" which
  supports writing "<b>declarative</b>, <b>statically
  typed</b> code". It may be optimized for academic
  buzzwords you've never heard of but... is it any good
  for writing code <span>in the way that you'd write
  <b>Perl</b>, <b>Python</b>, or <b>Ruby</b>?</span>
</div>
<div>
  What are strong types, and why are we so frightened
  of them anyway? Can you develop interactively
  in&nbsp; Haskell, the way you would in a dynamic
  language?<br>
  <br>
  Does Haskell have <b>"whipuptitude"</b> (being able
  to get things done quickly) as well as
  <b>"manipulexity"</b> (being able to manipulate
  complex things)? And perhaps most importantly, can writing Haskell be *fun*?
</div>
<div>Haskell is founded on decades of the finest
<b>mathematical</b> and <b>computer science</b>
research.&nbsp; Perl, quite demonstrably isn't... but
why do so many Perl programmers also love Haskell?<br>
<br>
</div>
<div>
<b>Audrey Tang</b> wrote the first prototype for
<b>Perl 6</b>, Pugs, in Haskell, and coined the phrase
"lambdacamel" for the substantial crossover between the
languages.
</div>
<div>
What does a Perl programmer make of Haskell?&nbsp; What
are the lessons that can be learned (in either direction).&nbsp; And do the
languages have more in common than
you might have thought?
