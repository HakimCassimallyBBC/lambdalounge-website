<div>This month we have Lee Kitching giving us a talk
on&nbsp; <a href="https://haskell-servant.github.io/"
target="_self">Servant</a>, a Haskell DSL for creating
HTTP APIs.<br>
<br>
We'll be meeting @madlabuk at the usual time of 7pm.<br>
<br>
API endpoints in Servant are represented as types which
ensures implementations conform to the definition and
enables safe routing and automatic client generation.<br>
<br>
The talk will cover how to use Servant to create web
APIs, and examine some of the features of the Haskell
type system which make it possible.<br>
