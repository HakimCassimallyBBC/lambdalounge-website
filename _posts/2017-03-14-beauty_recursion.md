   <b>Discovering the beauty of recursion and pattern
   matching</b><br>
   <br>
   We're meeting on Monday <b>20</b>th Mar at 7pm at
   <b>MadLab</b> where <a href=
   "https://twitter.com/qmacro">DJ Adams</a> will speak
   about one of the essential features of functional
   programming: <b>recursion.</b><br>
   <br>
   Moving from an imperative mindset across to a more
   functional one requires some rewiring of your brain.
   One of the areas where this is particularly noticeable
   is understanding how iteration is achieved in languages
   without explicit loop constructs. In this talk, we'll
   look at recursion as a fundamental building block, and
   discover how pattern matching in Haskell, Clojure, Elm,
   Elixir and even JavaScript is a beautiful thing.
