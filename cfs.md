## Call for Speakers

(See [our recent announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/lambda-lounge-manchester/exbzHl6A470) for full details!)

If you've been to any of our meetings, you'll know that we can guarantee an enthusiastic and welcoming crowd.
We abide by a simple but effective [Code of Conduct](http://www.lambdalounge.org.uk/doc/conduct)

And never fear, it doesn't matter whether you are an enthusiastic beginner to FP, or have multiple computer science Ph.Ds:  Just in the last 6 months we've had talks about:

 * `*` basics of recursion and pattern matching
 * `*` programming in the threaded function style
 * `*` an introduction to Elixir
 * `*` data structures of text editors

We welcome all, and are very keen to show a good example by encouraging a diverse range of speakers!

Please let us put our money where our mouth is by offering to pay for reasonable travel, food, and accommodation costs for any speakers from any traditionally under-represented groups (be it for example gender, sexuality, ethnicity, social background, or if you would otherwise be unable to attend financially).

If you have any doubts about whether your topic is suitable or you have enough experience to talk, please get in touch!  If you don't feel you can carry a whole
hour slot, we may be able to arrange a session with 2 or 3 speakers, or bring you
into an evening of very short "lightning talks".
